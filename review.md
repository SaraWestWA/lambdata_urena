Code clear with useful doc strings.

isit_float  - functions as described, misspelled integer on line 15

datetime_columns - accidentally mixed the year & month into one column, it will work as expected if corrected.

Dead_poets_society - very creative

The '__repr__' and '__string__' methods have the same output, they are intended to be different, this link explains:
https://pythonprogramming.net/__str__-__repr__-intermediate-python-tutorial/#:~:text=The%20__str__%20method,descriptive%20of%20that%20exact%20object.
(new informtion for me, too).

Import and run pylint & pydocstyle for pep8 compliance details. I also like to use this site: http://pep8online.com/
